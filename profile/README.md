I have worked for a long time as a freelance Smalltalk developer for government agencies and insurance companies. I have used Smalltalk since 1993. Digitalk/V, SmalltalkAgents, SmallScript, VisualAge, Squeak, Pharo, and VisualWorks. Other programming languages I have used over the years are Realbasic, Objective-C, Scala, Dart, Elixir, and Swift. And before that: Basic, Pascal, Pearl, Lisp, and Assembler.
